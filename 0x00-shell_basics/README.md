#Shell Scripting Basics Exercises

Exercise 0: pwd === print working directory

Exercise 1: ls === list directory contents

Exercise 2: cd === change directory

Exercise 3: ls -l === list directory contents in long form

Exercise 4: ls -la === list directory contents in long form, including hidden files

Exercise 5: ls -la Note: Are files inherently ordered?

Exercise 6: mkdir /tmp/holberton Create a holberton directory inside the tmp directory

Exercise 7: mv /tmp/betty /tmp/holberton/betty Move file betty, which is located inside the tmp directory, to the holberton directory, which is also located inside the tmp directory. This exercise required some dir traversing.

Exercise 8: rm /tmp/holberton/betty Remove file betty located in tmp/holberton directory.

Exercise 9: rmdir /tmp/holberton Remove directory holberton located in directory tmp.

Exercise 10: cd - Change directory to the previous directory you were in.

Exercise 11: ls -la . .. /boot List all files/directories, including hidden files/directories, from 3 separate directories: current directory, parent of working directory, and /boot directory. The ls command allows multiple directories to be listed separated by spaces.

Exercise 12: file /tmp/iamafile Prints the type of file iamafile.

Exercise 13: ln -s /bin/ls ls Create a symbolic link named ls for /bin/ls

Exercise 14: cp -u *.html .. Copy all html files from the current directory to the parent directory, but only copy files that didn't exist in the parent directory or are newer versions than the ones that already exist in the parent directory. The -u option didn't show on the terminal manual page. The -u option copies the file into the directory if its a newer version. If the file doesn't exist in the directory, it will copy over. The -n option works for copying files that don't exist in the parent directory, but it doesn't check if the file is a newer version or not.

Exercise 15: mv [[:upper:]]* /tmp/u Move all files that begin with a capital letter to /tmp/u

Exercise 16: rm *~ Deletes all files in the current directory that end with a ~tch again.
