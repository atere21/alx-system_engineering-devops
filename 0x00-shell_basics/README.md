In this project, I underwent an introductory crash course in the Shell. I learned how to navigate directories using 
cd, pwd, ls, how to look around using ls,
less and file, and how to manipulate files with cp, mv, rm, and mkdir.
Further, I practiced working with the type, which, help, and man commands, implementing wildcards, reading man pages, creating links
using keyboard shortcuts in Bash.
