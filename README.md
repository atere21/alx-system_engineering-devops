## ✍️ This repository contains programs written for the system engineering and DevOps track at ALX AFRICA. 
## In these projects, I worked with Bash and practiced writing Bash scripts to automate tasks.
## I learned about the OSI model and various Linux networking tools. Further, I configured a distributed system - two web servers and one load balancer - for deployment of my AirBnB project using Nginx, HAProxy, certbot, ufw, and MySQL.
